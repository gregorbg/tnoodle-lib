     * One example of where this is useful is a puzzle like the square
     * one. Someone extending Puzzle to implement SquareOnePuzzle is left
     * with the question of whether to allow turns that leave the puzzle
     * incapable of doing a /.
     * <br><br>
     * If getSuccessorsByName() returns states that cannot do a /, then
     * generateRandomMoves() will hang because any move that can be
     * applied to one of those states is redundant.
     * <br><br>
     * Alternatively, if getSuccessorsByName() only returns states that
     * can do a /, AlgorithmBuilder's isRedundant() breaks.
     * Here's why:<br>
     * Imagine a solved square one. Lets say we pick the turn (1,0) to
     * apply to it, and now we're considering applying (2,0) to it.
     * Obviously this is the exact same state you would have achieved by
     * just applying (3,0) to the solved puzzle, but isRedundant()
     * only checks for this against the previous moves that commute with
     * (2,0). movesCommute("(1,0)", "(2,0)") will only return
     * true if (2,0) can be applied to a solved square one, even though
     * it results in a state that cannot
     * be slashed.
